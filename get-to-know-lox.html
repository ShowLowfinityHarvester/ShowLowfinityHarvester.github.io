    <h3>Weather Synopsis (Product #2; Done After Station ID):</h3>
    <p>Header - Here is the latest weather synopsis.</p>
    <p>NOTE: Ever since Hurricane Hilary in August 2023, during major severe weather threats (Usually for at least an SPC MRGL Risk and/or WPC MDT Risk), LOX would not read the actual synopsis text but rather the Short and Long Term forecasts. The weather synopsis header will still be used for this occasion. The part that says “.SHORT TERM (WDY-WDY)...DD/HMM XM.” would not be read but the part that says “.LONG TERM (WDY-WDY)...DD/HMM XM.” would be read. Sometimes, but very rarely, during the threat for conditions like gale force winds in the waters, this same occasion would happen but with the MARINE section of the Area Forecast Discussion. The part that says “.MARINE…DD/HMM XM.” will not be read.</p>

    <h3>Forecasts (Product #3; Done After Station ID):</h3>
    <p>(These are based off the latest forecast zone layouts for Southwest California. To receive stuff from 2022-2023 and 2016-2022, please head to the “OLD CYCLE WALKTHROUGHS” section of this document.)</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>
    <p>NOTE: All LOX Stations will use the inland coast zone for coastal forecasts and don't say "inland" with the header. KIH31 says Santa Barbara County Central Coast as "Santa Barbara Central Coast", while KIH34 says that same zone as "Santa Barbara County North Coast". KIH34 also replaces the header for Santa Barbara County Southeastern Coasts' Forecast as "Santa Barbara County Southeastern Coast County" instead of the average forecast header. WNG584 says the Catalina and Santa Barbara Islands Zone as "Catalina Island, including the city of Avalon". No product pauses are done in between each forecast if the station has multiple, but rather a period instead. These include KIH31, KIH34, and KWO37/WZ2505.</p>
